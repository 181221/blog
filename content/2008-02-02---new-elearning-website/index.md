I've been putting some final touches on a website I built for a class running at BYU this semester on web analytics. You can visit the site [here][0]. I did a [write-up about the site][1] for Drupal's education working group. I discuss the design principles that guided my construction of the site.  

A bit from the write-up:  


> We recently created a [community learning space][0] for a web analytics class at [BYU][2]. We directed students to create individual blogs on commercial blogging platforms such as blogspot, wordpress, and elsewhere. We are then using [FeedAPI][3] to aggregate the student blogs and comments ([see list of student feeds][4]) into the community site. In addition, we're aggregating blogs from prominent web analytic experts ([see list of expert feeds][5]). A wiki and spot for announcements round out the list of features.
