I spent the morning converting my blog from [Wordpress][0] to [Drupal][1]. I figured that since I build all my sites using Drupal and I'm [building a memetracker module for Drupal as part of Google Summer of Code][2], I should switch my personal website/blog to Drupal. Wordpress is a great blogging platform but I'm glad now to be on Drupal. Drupal isn't just a blogging platform like Wordpress but a full-powered CMS that's used to power large commercial websites like [Popular Science][3] and [The Onion][4]. I've felt a little constrained in what I could do on Wordpress.
