Since [recent changes in my life][0] have forced me to look for new employment, I've had to relearn the long-forgotten art of writing a resume. Since the actual process of writing a resume is fairly straightforward, and boring, I decided to spice things up by figuring out how to do it in [Latex][1], a recent hobby of mine.

Googling found quite a few different Latex resume templates to start from and my favorite by far was [this one][2], conveniently already on Github. So I quickly forked the example resume and modified it to fit my needs. I was very happy how it turned out and think it looks miles better than any previous Microsoft Word template resume I've produced.

I've attached the finished resume to this post. You can also see the source for the resume at [https://github.com/KyleAMathews/kjh-vita/blob/master/kyle-resume.tex][3]. Feel free to fork my version and modify to meet your needs. Most distributions of Latex should have all the dependencies you need. The three fonts I've used, Minion Pro, Myriad Pro, and Inconsolata are all freely available. The first two are distributed with Adobe Reader. The latter can be [downloaded here.][4]
