Russia really really scares me.  

  

First was their invasion of Georgia.  

  

Then this past week, an editor of an online newspaper critical of the Government of the Russian republic Ingushetia was [killed while in Police custody][0]. This [Wikipedia page lists 21 journalist who have been killed][1] since Russian President (dictator?) Vladimir Putin came to power in 2000\.  

  

It seems there's still a lot of evil in the evil empire.
