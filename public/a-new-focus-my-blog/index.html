<p>This summer I&#39;ve been hired on part-time by the eBusiness center at BYU to do research into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_software">social software</a>. Specifically, I and the professor I&#39;m working with <a href="http://www.clintrogersonline.com/blog/">Dr. Clint Rogers</a>, are interested in how social software can be used to support learning -- an approach commonly referred to as &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-learning#E-Learning_2.0">elearning2.0</a>&quot;.  </p>
<p>So for the rest of this summer (and hopefully on into the fall) I plan to use this blog as a sounding board as I reason through different ideas and questions I have about about social software.</p>
