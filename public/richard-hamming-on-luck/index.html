<p>From Richard Hamming&#39;s classic and must-read talk, &quot;<a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html">You and Your Research</a>&quot;.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is indeed an element of luck, and no, there isn&#39;t. The prepared mind sooner or later finds something important and does it. So yes, it is luck. <em>The particular thing you do is luck, but that you do something is not.</em>  </p>
