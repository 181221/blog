Quick announcement post.

First I'm leaving [Pantheon](http://getpantheon.com), the startup I've been working at the past two years.
It's been a fantastic run and I've loved working there. They have a fantastic
team and product and it's been a pleasure helping build the best Drupal (and now Wordpress)
professional hosting platform.

Highlights include:

* Rebuilding the Pantheon dashboard from the ground up as a realtime single-page-app.
* [Multidev](http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/10/pantheon-multidev/) — cloud development environments for teams.
Basically Git for the entire stack (files, db, and code) not just code. It's been a huge hit for customers with larger teams of developers.
* [Pantheon One](https://www.getpantheon.com/pantheon-one) — 
a suite of tools for customers administering 100s to 1000s of websites.

Now that I've left Pantheon, for the indefinite future I'll be freelancing and working my way through a long list
of side-projects and books that have been accumulating. [Contact me](mailto:mathews.kyle@gmail.com) if you have interesting
problems you'd like help with.

I'm also back in the blogging game. I've rebuilt my blog with a custom static site generator (more about that in future posts)
and have a number of topics I'll be exploring here.
