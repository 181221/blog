<p>I&#39;ve just made a new writing goal -- I will write 200 words a day -- 100 words in my journal and 100 words for my blog. This isn&#39;t much really, just 4 paragraphs or so. Some days if I want to write more, I can or course, but I&#39;m never to write less.  </p>
<p>(Later) I&#39;ve changed my mind after thinking it over. I need a goal that is completely realistic. The idea for setting a word target for my writing came from a <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2004/10/20/time-management-tips" title="blog post on writing productivity">blog post on productivity over at Crooked Timber</a>. The writer said that the main productivity killer for academics are distractions that pull them from writing. The key to writing productivity is to write at least something every day. Something is better then nothing and little things add up to big things. So even though 200 words for my journal/blog isn&#39;t much, I can foresee days where I won&#39;t reach my target. So I&#39;m dropping the number a bit to 50 words for both categories - again with the caveat that I can go over -- just as long as I reach 50 words every day. And speaking of which, I&#39;ve already written over 200 words -- and I think I&#39;ll post this as well so I&#39;ve exceeded both my journal and blog writing goals. Wow, my goals are working already!</p>
