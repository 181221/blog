        <p>I recently (re)read a <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000840.html">great post on Coding Horror</a> which pointed me towards an article by <a href="http://www.kottke.org/07/03/public-and-permanent/">Jason Kottke who noted that many successful web2.0 projects</a> are a result of taking &quot;something that everyone does with their friends and make it public and permanent. (Permanent as in permalinked.)&quot;  </p>
<p>Some examples:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://blogger.com">Blogger</a> = public email messages.</strong> (1999) Instead of &quot;Dear Bob, Check out this movie.&quot; it&#39;s &quot;Dear People I May or May Not Know Who Are Interested in Film Noir, check out this movie. If you like it, maybe we can be friends.&quot;  </p>
<p><strong><a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a> = public photo sharing.</strong> (2004) Flickr co-founder Caterina Fake said in a recent interview: &quot;When we started the company, there were dozens of other photosharing companies such as Shutterfly, but on those sites there was no such thing as a public photograph -- it didn&#39;t even exist as a concept -- so the idea of something &#39;public&#39; changed the whole idea of Flickr.&quot;  </p>
<p><strong><a href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</a> = public home videos.</strong> (2005) Bob Saget was onto something.  </p>
<p><strong><a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> = public IM.</strong> (2006) I don&#39;t think it&#39;s any coincidence that one of the people responsible for Blogger is also responsible for Twitter.   </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love these examples because that&#39;s exactly the same thing I&#39;m trying to do with the social learning platform I&#39;m building. Taking what was previously private (classroom discussions/instruction, hallway debate) and making it public, open, and permanent.  </p>
<p>This is has many many powerful effects (all of which I won&#39;t mention right now). But one quick recent example of this principle.  </p>
<p>One of the classes at BYU using Island this semester is ISys 401 Systems Analysis. The teacher recently got an email from a student -- and instead of answering the question through email, he decided to <a href="https://island.byu.edu/content/hw-3-backlog-question">make his answer public and post it to the class group.</a>  </p>
<p>The student wrote:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Question:  </p>
<p>Dr. Liddle,  </p>
<p>I have read the scrum guide that is listed in the course schedule, and even looked up on wikipedia what a backlog is, but I still don&#39;t understand what exactly you want us to do for homework 3. What do you mean by create a backlog of user stories from 401? If you could even point me in the direction of where to find a more precise definition on what a backlog, then that would be helpful as well.  </p>
<p>Thank you  </p>
<p>[Member of the ISys Core]  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Dr. Liddle went on to answer the question.  </p>
<p>Whether Dr. Liddle answered the student&#39;s question through email or through posting it to the class group -- the action had the same effect -- the original student&#39;s question was answered. But what else happened as a result of making it public?   </p>
