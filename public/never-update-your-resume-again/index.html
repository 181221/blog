<p>I&#39;ve <a href="/why-i-blog-part-2/">written before how your blog can replace your resume</a> but I enjoyed reading another blogger&#39;s experience. I haven&#39;t had the chance yet to send my blog url instead of a resume but I have been contacted about a job once directly because of what I&#39;ve written here and elsewhere.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I hated updating my resume. It is such a brilliantly inefficient medium to communicate your value proposition.  </p>
<p>Now when situations of resumes arise, I send the url for the blog. The longer it exists the more valuable it becomes as a alternative resume.  </p>
<p>On blogs you can&#39;t fake it (atleast not for a very long time) and it so perfectly reflects your intelligence, your character, your values, your smarts (or lack there of) and so on and so forth. You can &quot;fake&quot; the piece of paper, you can&#39;t fake a blog.  </p>
<p>Of course the flip side is also true. If you have a great blog you might not have to go look for a job. They&#39;ll come find you. I am sure all the bloggers in our space get at least two job offers a week. :)  </p>
<p>And here is perhaps the nicest benefit of having your own blog (and making sure your potential new employer has it and has sent it to the interview committee): They won&#39;t ask you silly questions.  </p>
<p>They have a good idea of who you actually are and smart interviewers just get to the point. And that is a good thing.  </p>
