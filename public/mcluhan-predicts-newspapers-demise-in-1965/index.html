<p>Reading through &quot;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Media-Extensions-Marshall-McLuhan/dp/0262631598">Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man</a>&quot; by Marshall McLuhan, I came across this gem of a quote:  </p>

</blockquote>
<p>And I think we all know how that&#39;s turned out.</p>
