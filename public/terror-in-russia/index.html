<p>Russia really really scares me.  </p>
<p>First was their invasion of Georgia.  </p>
<p>Then this past week, an editor of an online newspaper critical of the Government of the Russian republic Ingushetia was <a href="http://www.cpj.org/news/2008/europe/russ02sep08na.html">killed while in Police custody</a>. This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_journalists_killed_in_Russia">Wikipedia page lists 21 journalist who have been killed</a> since Russian President (dictator?) Vladimir Putin came to power in 2000.  </p>
<p>It seems there&#39;s still a lot of evil in the evil empire.  </p>
