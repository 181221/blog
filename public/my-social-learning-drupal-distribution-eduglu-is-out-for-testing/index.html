<p>The first alpha of Eduglu is out and ready for testing. Download it at <a href="http://community.eduglu.org/release-announcement/node/8">http://community.eduglu.org/release-announcement/node/8</a>  </p>
<h2 id="what-i-hope-to-accomplish-with-this-first-alpha-">What I hope to accomplish with this first Alpha?</h2>
<p>My hope is that releasing this first of Eduglu will start a conversation about what shape should a Drupal educational distro take. Eduglu is a partial-implementation of my vision of what an Drupal education distro should be. But I&#39;m well aware that my vision is limited in many ways and that the problems I&#39;ve designed Eduglu to solve probably don&#39;t even begin to cover all the different problems you as a collective are trying to solve.  </p>
<p>So let&#39;s get the conversation going. What do you think Eduglu should be? What problems are you facing? What would your dream social learning website be? If you&#39;re building some sort of social learning tool on Drupal already (as I know many of you are), what are you trying to do and how?  </p>
<p>So this first alpha is a chance for us to talk about what Eduglu should be. Once we&#39;ve decided what Eduglu should be, we can start pushing toward a stable Beta release, fixing bugs and adding missing features.  </p>
