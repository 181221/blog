<h1>Ubuntu meta-packages website</h1>
<p>I watched the recent introduction of ubuntu-studio recently with great interest. Anyone who wants to have an audio/graphic/video Linux workstation can now just download Ubuntu Studio. That’s great because it helps remove one barrier to using Linux — figuring out what software to use.</p>
<p>Many new Linux users are confused about what software to use. It’s great that there are some 20,000 software packages now available in the Ubuntu repositories — but how is the poor new user to find the software that does what they need? Separate the grain from the chaff so to speak.</p>
<p>So Ubuntu Studio is a recommend package list. The creators of Ubuntu Studio say that these are the best Linux programs to do these tasks — whether that be graphics, audio, or video editing. Then they make it simple to install by providing a DVD with the software or a meta-package that people can download from the Ubuntu repositories.<br>I had a thought — what if there were meta-packages for every task. Meta-packages for stuff like web-development, games, java programming, music listening, school work, statistical analysis, kernel hacking, etc. For any imaginable task.<br>Put these meta-packages on a website. Then visitors would rank, review, etc. Visitors could browse meta-packages by category, order by rankings, number of reviews, number of downloads and so forth.</p>
<p>Once a visitor found a package they wanted. They’d click install. The file to download would be XML encoded with the programs to install. In Ubuntu, there’d be a nice GUI that’d intercept the xml and install the programs as normal via apt-get.</p>
<p>I think this would be very simple but effective way for introducing the great Linux software available.<br>What do you think? Would this help you?</p>
