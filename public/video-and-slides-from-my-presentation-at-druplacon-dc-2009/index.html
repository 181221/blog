<p>I had the amazing opportunity to present this past March at <a href="http://dc2009.drupalcon.org/">Drupalcon DC 2009</a> on my research and work on <a href="https://island.byu.edu">https://island.byu.edu</a>  </p>
<p>It was by far the largest crowd I&#39;ve ever presented (400) and the longest (1 hour) but I think it turned out pretty well -- no rotten tomatoes anyways -- and I really enjoyed the experience. The <a href="http://dc2009.drupalcon.org/session/building-advanced-social-networks-large-us-university">bulk of my talk</a> was on how to design effective effective social networks pulling from my blog posts earlier this year on <a href="/how-design-social-networking-site-using-social-objects">building social networks</a> with <a href="/what-are-social-objects">social objects</a>.  </p>
