        <h1>Ubuntu 6.10 - Edgy Eft - thoughts on upgrading from Dapper</h1>
<p>Updated my dapper installation on my laptop to Edgy a while ago. It went well. I jotted down my impressions and installation steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>faster boot - 56 seconds from shutting down computer restart and logging in—probably 5-10 secs faster then with Dapper.</li>
<li>added tomboy notes / sticky notes / system monitor - adjusted to have CPU/memory/network / battery monitor / force quit /</li>
<li>wow, only 109 MB of ram used upon boot up. Huge difference — Dapper was always around 150 MB upon boot up</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="programs-installed">Programs Installed</h2>
<ul>
<li>Adobe Acrobat 7.0</li>
<li>Agave - color scheme creator</li>
<li>Alien - converts RPMs to DEBs</li>
<li>Amarok - best music player for Linux</li>
<li>Beagle - desktop search</li>
<li>Ethereal - now called wireshark — network sniffer</li>
<li>Inkscape - vector drawing program</li>
<li>Java SDK 5</li>
<li>K3B - best Linux CD burning software</li>
<li>LyX - WYSIWYM (What You See Is What You Mean) editor. GUI for LATEX</li>
<li>Scribus - excellent DTP (desktop publisher for Linux)</li>
<li>VLC - Plays anything you throw at it.</li>
<li>Webilder - downloads backgrounds from flickr and rotates them</li>
<li>Wine - (Wine Is Not an Emulator)</li>
<li>GFTP</li>
<li>Bluefish</li>
</ul>
<p>Firefox 2.0 is very cool - tab restore, search suggest/memory for google, individual tab delete. Seems to have eliminated memory leak — used to be that after a few hours of using firefox memory usage would be over 250 MBs now (depending on how many tabs are open) is much less ~ 100 MBs</p>
<p>So I like it. As some have commented <a href="http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=06/10/26/1552208">Edgy isn’t so edgy</a> (Also a comment about the <a href="http://www.netsplit.com/blog/articles/2006/10/27/not-that-edgy">lack of ‘edginess’ from an Ubuntu developer</a>). It seems the changes from Hoary to Dapper were more dramatic. Changes were mostly subtle, tweaks here and there, improvements to programs etc. Linux and Ubuntu are at a stage of maturity that dramatic improvement are hard to pull off. A math analogy, if you add 1 to 1 that is a 100% improvement. If you add 1 to 2 that is a 50% improvement. If you continue that on upward, adding 1 to 100 is only a 1% improvement. Linux is still making good progress just it is not as obvious now due to the substantial work already completed.</p>
