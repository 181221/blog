        <p>Updated my dapper installation on my laptop to Edgy a while ago. It went well. I jotted down my impressions and installation steps:  </p>
<ul>
<li>faster boot - 56 seconds from shutting down computer restart and logging in -- probably 5-10 secs faster then with Dapper.<br>-added tomboy notes / sticky notes / system monitor - adjusted to have CPU/memory/network / battery monitor / force quit /<br>-wow, only 109 MB of ram used upon boot up. Huge difference -- Dapper was always around 150 MB upon boot up  </li>
</ul>
<p>-Programs Installed<br>Adobe Acrobat 7.0<br>Agave - color scheme creator<br>Alien - converts RPMs to DEBs<br>Amarok - best music player for Linux<br>Beagle - desktop search<br>Ethereal - now called wireshark -- network sniffer<br>Inkscape - vector drawing program<br>Java SDK 5<br>K3B - best Linux CD burning software<br>LyX - WYSIWYM (What You See Is What You Mean) editor. GUI for LATEX<br>Scribus - excellent DTP (desktop publisher for Linux)<br>VLC - Plays anything you throw at it.<br>Webilder - downloads backgrounds from flickr and rotates them<br>Wine - (Wine Is Not an Emulator)<br>GFTP<br>Bluefish  </p>
<p>Firefox 2.0 is very cool - tab restore, search suggest/memory for google, individual tab delete. Seems to have eliminated memory leak -- used to be that after a few hours of using firefox memory usage would be over 250 MBs now (depending on how many tabs are open) is much less ~ 100 MBs  </p>
<p>So I like it. As some have commented <a href="http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=06/10/26/1552208">Edgy isn&#39;t so edgy</a> (Also a comment about the <a href="http://www.netsplit.com/blog/articles/2006/10/27/not-that-edgy">lack of &#39;edginess&#39; from an Ubuntu developer</a>). It seems the changes from Hoary to Dapper were more dramatic. Changes were mostly subtle, tweaks here and there, improvements to programs etc. Linux and Ubuntu are at a stage of maturity that dramatic improvement are hard to pull off. A math analogy, if you add 1 to 1 that is a 100% improvement. If you add 1 to 2 that is a 50% improvement. If you continue that on upward, adding 1 to 100 is only a 1% improvement. Linux is still making good progress just it is not as obvious now due to the substantial work already completed.</p>
