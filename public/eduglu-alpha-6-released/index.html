        <h1>Eduglu Alpha 6 released</h1>
<p>Time for another Eduglu release! <a href="http://eduglu.com/content/eduglu-alpha-6">Download Alpha 6 at eduglu.com</a></p>
<p>There’s been lots of progress made since Alpha 5. Along with the usual assortment of bug fixes and tweaks, major new features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new Quiz feature based on the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/quiz">Drupal quiz module</a>. The Drupal quiz module has an extensive feature list and is widely used in the Drupal community. This is just the start of Eduglu’s quiz integration but it’s already provided a powerful boost to Eduglu’s capabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>The quiz feature isn’t enabled by default so to make it available to groups on your Eduglu install, enable this feature at admin/build/features.</p>
<ul>
<li>A searchable group membership directory. Group members can now easily browse/search the faces/names of their fellow group members</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="./membership_directory.png" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li>Group admin tools for managing members. It’s now easy to add and remove members from your groups as well as to promote and demote members to be group admin status.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="./group-members-admin-tool.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If you have feedback or find bugs, join us in the Drupal.org issue queue at drupal.org/project/eduglu and at the community.eduglu.org site.</p>
<p>If you’re upgrading from an earlier version of Eduglu:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run updates at update.php</li>
<li>Revert all features at admin/build/features</li>
<li>Clear all caches at admin/settings/performance</li>
</ul>
