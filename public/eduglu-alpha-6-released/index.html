<p>Time for another Eduglu release! <a href="http://eduglu.com/content/eduglu-alpha-6">Download Alpha 6 at eduglu.com</a>  </p>
<p>There&#39;s been lots of progress made since Alpha 5. Along with the usual assortment of bug fixes and tweaks, major new features include:  </p>
<ul>
<li>A new Quiz feature based on the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/quiz">Drupal quiz module</a>. The Drupal quiz module has an extensive feature list and is widely used in the Drupal community. This is just the start of Eduglu&#39;s quiz integration but it&#39;s already provided a powerful boost to Eduglu&#39;s capabilities.  </li>
</ul>
<p>The quiz feature isn&#39;t enabled by default so to make it available to groups on your Eduglu install, enable this feature at admin/build/features.  </p>
<ul>
<li>A searchable group membership directory. Group members can now easily browse/search the faces/names of their fellow group members  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Group admin tools for managing members. It&#39;s now easy to add and remove members from your groups as well as to promote and demote members to be group admin status.  </li>
</ul>
