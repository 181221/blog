<p>A book I read recently helped me finger out why school can be so irritating at times.  </p>
<p>The book is entitled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Weird-Ideas-That-Work-Sustaining/dp/0743212126">Weird Ideas that Work: 11 1/2 Practices for Promoting, Managing, and Sustaining Innovation</a>. One of its &quot;weird ideas&quot; is that companies should hire slow learners. Not stupid people but slow learners of the organization&#39;s code. A code is, the author explains, &quot;a company&#39;s &#39;knowledge and faiths,&#39; its history, memories, procedures, precedents, rules, and all those taken-for-granted, and often unspoken, assumptions about why things are supposed to be done in certain ways.&quot;  </p>
<p>He goes on to say that most companies hire &quot;fast learners&quot; who quickly learn to do things the &quot;right way&quot; and see things much as others do in the company. But companies that do innovative work need a different kind of worker, one who won&#39;t get &quot;brainwashed into thinking just like everyone else. They need people who avoid, ignore, or reject &#39;the heat of the herd. . .&#39;&quot;  </p>
<p>How do you find this sort of person? One suggestion he made is to hire smart people with bad grades. He says research has shown that many creative geniuses--including Edison and Darwin--were poor students.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Creativity researcher Dean Keith Simonton points out: &quot;To obtain high marks in school often requires a high degree of conformity to conventional ways of looking at the world and people.&quot; People who get good grades are often fast learners of social cues. By contrast, smart people who get bad grades are listening to their inner voice, doing <em>what they believe is interesting and right</em>. Simonton observes that &quot;one of the reasons creative talents often dislike school is that it can interfere with <em>what they really want to know</em>. When faced with the choice of reading a good book or studying for an exam, the extracurricular but still instructive diversion may win out.&quot; [italics mine]  </p>

<p>School irritates me because I&#39;m often told by teachers to do things and learn things I don&#39;t think are valuable. I have strong opinions about where I&#39;m going and what I need to know to get there. When demands from school align with my own interests things go well. But when they clash, school loses out.  </p>
<p>One of my guiding principles is maintaining control of my own destiny. I cede control of my experiences only to those with whom I have an unusual amount of trust. The trust threshold a person must meet before I&#39;m willing to give up control varies upon the importance of the activity but for learning especially, it is very high. There is nothing more important than what I know, what I think, and especially how I think. My thoughts are my destiny. And when I let someone influence my thoughts, my destiny partially becomes theirs. And there are very few teachers with whom I want to share destinies.</p>
