        <p>From John Gardner, former secretary of health, education, and welfare under Lyndon B. Johnson. He pinpoints what&#39;s wrong with virtually every activist group.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The possibility of coherent community action is diminished today by the deep mutual suspicions and antagonisms among various groups in our national life.  </p>
<p>As these antagonisms become more intense, the pathology is much the same. . . . The ingredients are, first, a deep conviction on the part of the group as to its own limitless virtue or the overriding sanctity of its cause; second, grave doubts concerning the moral integrity of all others; third, a chronically aggrieved feeling that power has fallen into the hands of the unworthy (that is, the hands of others). . . .  </p>
<p>Political extremism involves two prime ingredients: An excessively simple diagnosis of the world&#39;s ills and a conviction that there are identifiable villains back of it all. . . . Blind belief in one&#39;s cause and a low view of the morality of other Americans---these seem mild failings. But they are the soil in which ranker weeds take root . . . terrorism, and the deep, destructive cleavages that paralyze society.</p>
