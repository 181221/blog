<p>Since <a href="/blog/2011/04/22/eduglu-enters-deadpool">recent changes in my life</a> have forced me to look for new employment, I&#39;ve had to relearn the long-forgotten art of writing a resume. Since the actual process of writing a resume is fairly straightforward, and boring, I decided to spice things up by figuring out how to do it in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">Latex</a>, a recent hobby of mine.  </p>
<p>Googling found quite a few different Latex resume templates to start from and my favorite by far was <a href="http://kjhealy.github.com/kjh-vita/">this one</a>, conveniently already on Github. So I quickly forked the example resume and modified it to fit my needs. I was very happy how it turned out and think it looks miles better than any previous Microsoft Word template resume I&#39;ve produced.  </p>
<p>I&#39;ve attached the finished resume to this post. You can also see the source for the resume at <a href="https://github.com/KyleAMathews/kjh-vita/blob/master/kyle-resume.tex">https://github.com/KyleAMathews/kjh-vita/blob/master/kyle-resume.tex</a>. Feel free to fork my version and modify to meet your needs. Most distributions of Latex should have all the dependencies you need. The three fonts I&#39;ve used, Minion Pro, Myriad Pro, and Inconsolata are all freely available. The first two are distributed with Adobe Reader. The latter can be <a href="http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html">downloaded here.</a></p>
