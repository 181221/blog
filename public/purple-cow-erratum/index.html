<p>I&#39;ve been reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Purple-Cow-Transform-Business-Remarkable/dp/159184021X">&quot;Purple Cow&quot;</a> by <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/">Seth Godin</a> lately and am loving it. I read one of the case studies in the book today and found it quite funny in light of the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aKtbJPOEkO.U">500,000 iPhones Apple sold last Friday</a>.  </p>

<p>Guess what? Cell phones are now boring. Just about everyone who needs a phone now has one. Most people who want a phone have one, too. The companies that built that revolution now have a problem: What next?What do they have to put into a phone to get people to notice it? Is it possible to make a remarkable phone anymore?</p>

<p>It&#39;s obvious now that Apple has figured out how to make a remarkable phone with its iPhone, a purple cow worthy phone, while Nokia and Motorola have not.  </p>
<p>Perhaps it&#39;s time for Seth to update his case study?</p>
