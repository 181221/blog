        <h1>Why I blog -- Part 2</h1>
<p>A year ago in just <a href="/why-i-blog-part-1/">my second blog post</a>, I explained why I write a blog. My answer then (and now) is I keep a blog as an intellectual journal of sorts. Blogging is my way of pulling together into a coherent form all the stray thoughts rolling around in my mind. Writing helps me sift the good thoughts from all the bad and fit them all together in a logical pattern.  </p>
<p>Keeping an intellectual journal is the main reason for writing my blog. My secondary reason is pure economics. Blogging is a loss-leader of sorts.  Through this blog I market myself and my ideas to people who I hope to do business with eventually.  </p>
<p>Along those lines I read a <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2007/10/comment_is_free.cfm">blog post today from The Economist</a> website. The author was commenting on a <a href="http://files.ssds.ucdavis.edu/chsc/Discover_Your_Inner_Economist.mp4">recent podcast on the economics of blogging by Tyler Cowen</a> (of <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/">Marginal Revolution</a> fame).  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>While the direct economic return to authoring a blog may not appear to justify the effort, the prospect of actively demonstrating one&#39;s skillset for an interested public, many members of which work in talent-hungry organisations that pay real salaries, is an attractive one. Why waste time submitting CVs [I had to google this one, CV is resume in American-speak], when you could cultivate an audience of potential employers intimately familiar with your talents?  </p>
<p>Interestingly, this effect could generate a filtering effect on the blogosphere quite opposed to the market for lemon model <a href="http://rodrik.typepad.com/dani_rodriks_weblog/2007/10/is-the-econ-blo.html">proposed</a> by Dani Rodrik. If blog writers generally have employment in mind, we should expect those with strong resum√©s but lackluster ideas to abstain from extensive blogging, while those whose critical and analytical skills run ahead of the experience and education categories on their CVs should embrace blogging as a means to signal their exceptional fitness. We would expect those with most to gain from blogging to blog more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve always found school boring and homework a less then optimal use of my time. So my grades reflect that. &quot;Good students&quot; use grades as a signaling mechanism. A student with good grades is telling potential employers, &quot;I&#39;m reasonably intelligent and can tolerate boredom&quot; -- which is what&#39;s really required at school and most jobs.  </p>
<p>As my grades aren&#39;t going to impress anyone, I compensate by blogging. I use this blog to &quot;show off&quot;, so to speak, my critical and analytic skills, my ideas, and my passion for social software, learning, and collaboration to potential employers.  </p>
<p>But for now this is all theory--whether this works or not is still a bit up in the air. . . but in the meantime it&#39;s better then homework. . . and since I&#39;m done writing, back now to accounting homework I guess :></p>
