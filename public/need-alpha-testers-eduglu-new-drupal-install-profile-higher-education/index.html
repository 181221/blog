        <h1>Looking for Alpha Testers for Eduglu, a new Drupal Install Profile for Higher Education</h1>
<p>I’ve been working on a <a href="https://island.byu.edu">social learning site based on Drupal</a> for the past two years as a student at Brigham Young University and am now working towards readying it for its maiden release into the world as a full-fledged Drupal install profile.   </p>
<p>My goal with <a href="http://eduglu.com">Eduglu</a> is to:   </p>
<p>a) Provide a <strong>superb out-of-the-box social learning engine</strong> to help departments, clubs, classrooms, and other campus groups communicate, collaborate, and learn with one another.   </p>
<p>b) Support a <strong>social learning platform</strong> which individual universities and Drupal shops can integrate with existing tools and services and use to build custom tools supporting specific learning practices.   </p>
<p>Or in simpler terms, <strong>Eduglu = robust social learning engine + pluggable educational tools</strong>.  </p>
<p>For Drupalers, Eduglu is built on the same stack of modules as <a href="http://openatrium.com">Open Atrium</a>; <a href="http://drupal.org/project/og">Organic Groups</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/spaces">Spaces</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/context">Context</a>, and <a href="http://drupal.org/project/features">Features</a>.  </p>
<p>I’m also working to start a company to provide commercial support and hosting for Eduglu.  </p>
<p>But we’re not there yet. My plan is to make the first beta release by Drupalcon where <a href="http://sf2010.drupal.org/conference/sessions/introducing-eduglu-new-drupal-install-profile-higher-education">I’ll be presenting more about Eduglu</a>. But to be ready by then, <strong>I need alpha testers</strong>. If you’re interested in becoming an alpha tester, <a href="http://kyle.mathews2000.com/contact">please contact me</a>. I’ll be preparing an initial release over the next couple of weeks.  </p>
<p>Also, if you do <strong>Drupal consulting in higher education</strong>, I’d love to work with you. <a href="http://kyle.mathews2000.com/contact">Please contact me</a> and let’s discuss how we can work together.  </p>
<p>Lastly, if you’re an <strong>educator working in higher ed</strong>, I’d love to talk to you as well. Especially people working at online or virtual colleges and community colleges. If there’s an educational tool you’ve dreamed of having — or tried building and failed — <a href="http://kyle.mathews2000.com/contact">contact me</a> and tell me about it and I might just build it for you.  </p>
<p>And if you’re not in one of the above three groups but know someone who is — please connect me with those people.  </p>
<p>I’ll be doing a bit of travel in a couple of weeks. I’ll be in Boston February 17th-20th, New York February 22-23 and Washington DC on the 24th-25th. If you’re in one of those cities and want to meet and talk Drupal/higher education, let’s get in touch!  </p>
<p>Thanks all! It’s going to be an exciting ride and I’m looking forward to it.</p>
