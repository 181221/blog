<p>I spent the morning converting my blog from <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> to <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a>. I figured that since I build all my sites using Drupal and I&#39;m <a href="http://kyle.mathews2000.com/node/40">building a memetracker module for Drupal as part of Google Summer of Code</a>, I should switch my personal website/blog to Drupal. Wordpress is a great blogging platform but I&#39;m glad now to be on Drupal. Drupal isn&#39;t just a blogging platform like Wordpress but a full-powered CMS that&#39;s used to power large commercial websites like <a href="http://www.popsci.com/">Popular Science</a> and <a href="http://www.theonion.com">The Onion</a>. I&#39;ve felt a little constrained in what I could do on Wordpress.</p>
