        <p>A small confession on my part, I love reading blogs. I&#39;ve been reading blogs for quite a while now, five years I&#39;d suppose. It has been my privilege during this time to read the discussions and thoughts of hundreds of different intelligent and opinionated blog authors from all around the earth. I&#39;m in college now, this fall will be my Junior year. Everyday I listen to lecture and read from textbooks and most don&#39;t hold a candle to my daily dose of blog news and analysis. The blog is the greatest conversational tool ever invented because seconds after I click publish for this post, it can be read across the world by thousands. Granted, this blog, along with most of the other <a href="http://www.blogherald.com/2005/10/10/the-blog-herald-blog-count-october-2005/">100 million</a> blogs in existence, won&#39;t be read much. But that&#39;s all right. Conversation is fun, even it&#39;s just with a few of your buds. I&#39;m just happy to join the party.</p>
