        <h1>school and learning</h1>
<p>I care a lot about learning. And I’ve thought a lot about it. Why I want to learn, how I learn best, and why it seems I often don’t learn. It’s an often quoted piece of wisdom that you learn the most when you fail. In the same way, you can improve the quality of your work on something by examining what parts you do poorly and improving those. As that is where your model or methodolgy for doing whatever is breaking down.</p>
<p>Schooling has long been the least productive source of learning for me. College, thankfully, does much better then high school — therefore somewhat justifying the thousands of dollars they take from me each year. but still has weaknesses.</p>
<p>I started reading a fascinating book this morning called “The Cluetrain”[add link]. What it was about is a subject for a different blog post, however it brought up the old irritiation I have with schools. Teaching done at school has several problems. Slow methods of learning - lecture, poorly motivated students that most be spoon-fed knowledge and/or students so drunken[think of better word] by schooling system that doesn’t encourage in the slightest independent learning/thinking that they can’t learn by themselves, and/or professors that don’t teach well.</p>
<p>I measure learning by “ah hah” moments. Those times, when your reading or thinking about something and the pieces come together and your understanding crystalizes. These are like little shots of drugs to keep me going. It seems these moments come few and far between at school and much more often when learning by myself or with other like-minded people.</p>
<p>Why? I learn things faster so often bored when professor going over things I already understand. Talking very slow way of transmiting knowledge as compared to reading. biggest thing to me is perspective.</p>
<p>We learn things by looking at stuff from different perspectives. How often is there something you know, think you understand it very well but then talk to someone who understands it differently [think of concrete example] and all of a sudden you understand it so much better.</p>
<p>It’s the difference between 2D and 3D. It’s like the difference on a movie between a static shot and a sweeping panoramic shot of a say a house. It’s the difference between trying to figure the height of a house from one [what is an example that people commonly grapple with or have experienced?] shot or 20 from all different angles and distances.</p>
<p>If you only read liberal or conservative political commentary, how well will you truely understand issuies as compared to reading from a variety of sources?</p>
<p>Professors only teach from one side of an issuie most of the time whether purposely or not. It’s hard to understand. Learning about project management. Textbook/professor has authoritative this is how it is. No nuance no subtiltiy. Just from my own little expereince in world know most projects aren’t managed like that.</p>
<p>Being a bit unfair. What I’m learning does have some practical value. It just seems it’s undigested. I get this big ball of knowledge thrown in my lap and I have to do the hard work of unravelinging it and making connections from it. It seems to me that something well-written books and excellent teaching have in common is they help you make connections. The World Wide <em>Web</em> is an excellent way of organizing information because it mimics how our brains stores and processes information. Think about the last time you had or read a really exciting idea. It explodes in your mind. Immediately you mind races making connections, oh, that is like this, that explains better this process, we can use that to improve such-and-such that we are doing.</p>
<p>I like to think of our brain as an intricate web of little nuggets of knowledge with thousands of connections strewn between them forming uncountable number of connections. As we think and reason, we sail along the webs between all the different knowledge and experiences we’ve had and build up a whatever.</p>
