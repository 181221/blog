<p>I&#39;m a big fan of Steven Covey&#39;s &quot;Seven Habits of Highly Effective People&quot; and of th freakonomics blog so when I made a connection today between the two, I knew I had to blog about it.  </p>
<p>A fundemental principle in Covey&#39;s book is that private victory must proceed public victory.<br>1. Focus on technique as opposed to outcome.<br>2. Set specific goals.<br>3. Get good, prompt feedback, and use it.  </p>
<p>Don&#39;t become an expert by trying to become an expert. You become an expert by molding yourself until you acquire the attributes of an expert. Then, naturally - almost without anymore effort on your part, people will recognize you as an expert.  </p>
<p>It&#39;s a very common pattern for a young start-up to come out with an amazing new product and for the business press to wander how the start-up became so good so quickly. This ignores the years of trial and effort the start-up went through to get where it is.  </p>
<p>What do I take from this? I want to do great things in my life. How will I do this? Not by setting out tomorrow on some great task (don&#39;t focus on the outcome) but by practicing basic techniques. Understanding myself, writing, reading, social skills, etc.<br>By mastering the skils of greatness, then naturally I&#39;ll be able to do great things.</p>
