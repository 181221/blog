<p>From British political philosopher Michael Oakeshott:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Conversation is not . . . a contest where a winner gets a prize, . . . it is an endless, unrehearsed, intellectual adventure in which in imagination we enter a variety of modes of understanding the world and ourselves. And, we are not disconcerted by the differences, or dismayed by the inconclusiveness of it all.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I really like that. Good conversation is good for the soul.  </p>
