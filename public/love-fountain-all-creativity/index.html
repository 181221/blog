        <h1>Love is the fountain for all creativity</h1>
<p>At a recent education conference, I attended a session on creativity. The teachers were reporting on their experiences in teaching a course on creativity to freshmen college students. They reported on some things that happened and we did some of the exercises they do in their classes. I was disappointed though as the session leaders focused on teaching the <em>behaviors</em> of creative people while completely missing what’s driving these behaviors.</p>
<p>Love is at the heart of all creative acts.</p>
<p>I can think of three reasons.</p>
<p>A creative thought is just another word for an excellent thought. Most ideas are average. Most people settle for ideas that are “good enough.” And why not? Thinking is hard and if the first idea that comes along is “good enough”, why not use it? But if you truly love something, you can’t settle for “good enough.” Think of any great athlete. They are great because their love for the game pushes them to practice more than comparable athletes. Any great artist, musician, architect is driven by their <em>passion</em> for the art. Even in fields not normally considered “creative”, the best in that field are the best because of their love for their craft. They do great and creative things because their love for their work pushes them beyond the “good enough.”</p>
<p>Fear of failure drives people to be average. Fear of failure recedes as hope, driven by love, takes its place. Most people are driven primarily by fear. They settle for the “safe” answer. They do the sure thing, take the safe job, do what pleases the client, etc. People who love something <em>can’t</em> settle on what’s safe as anything but the best for their beloved is not acceptable. Creative people, driven by love, behave recklessly in the eyes of their “saner” cousins.</p>
<p>People who love something pay attention to what they love. If you pay attention to something, you will soon know much more about the thing you love than those who don’t pay attention to it. By knowing more about this thing you will soon have better ideas on how to improve this thing than someone who doesn’t love this thing. A parent who loves their children will talk and play with them and get to know them and by knowing them better becomes a better parent. A teacher who loves their students will learn their sometimes hidden strengths and weaknesses and learn how to nurture each in the way most suited. And the same is every case you can imagine. The man who loves his town will pay attention to it and soon have better, more creative, ideas on how to improve it. What I find remarkable about people who don’t seem to love is how little</p>
