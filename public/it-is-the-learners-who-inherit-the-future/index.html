<p>&quot;The central task of education is to implant a will and a facility for learning; it should produce not learned but learning people. The truly human society is a learning society, where grandparents, parents, and children are students together.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;In a time of drastic change it is the learners who inherit the future. The learned usually find themselves equipped to live in a world that no longer exists.&quot;  </p>
