        <h1>Six principles for making new things</h1>
<p>I love it when someone writes what I’m thinking about writing. Saves me time.</p>
<p>Paul Graham posted a new essay today entitled “<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/newthings.html">Six Principles for Making New Things</a>.”<br>Here’s the juicy bit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I like to find (a) simple solutions (b) to overlooked problems (c) that actually need to be solved, and (d) deliver them as informally as possible, (e) starting with a very crude version 1, then (f) iterating rapidly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/newthings.html">Read the rest.</a></p>
<p>To add a few thoughts.<br>When I think of overlooked problems I think of a bell curve. Most people/companies/countries are average: thinking average thoughts and doing things in an average way. Their average thoughts/actions lead to average results. If you want exceptional results, you have to act and think in ways that are exceptional. Average=dead, the <a href="http://www.edgeperspectives.com/">edge is where the action</a> is at.</p>
