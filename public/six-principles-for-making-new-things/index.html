        <p>I love it when someone writes what I&#39;m thinking about writing. Saves me time.  </p>
<p>Paul Graham posted a new essay today entitled &quot;<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/newthings.html">Six Principles for Making New Things</a>.&quot;<br>Here&#39;s the juicy bit:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I like to find (a) simple solutions (b) to overlooked problems (c) that actually need to be solved, and (d) deliver them as informally as possible, (e) starting with a very crude version 1, then (f) iterating rapidly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/newthings.html">Read the rest.</a>  </p>
<p>To add a few thoughts.<br>When I think of overlooked problems I think of a bell curve. Most people/companies/countries are average: thinking average thoughts and doing things in an average way. Their average thoughts/actions lead to average results. If you want exceptional results, you have to act and think in ways that are exceptional. Average=dead, the <a href="http://www.edgeperspectives.com/">edge is where the action</a> is at.</p>
