<p>From the most excellent book, &quot;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Organization-Man-William-H-Whyte/dp/0812218191">The Organization Man</a>&quot;:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of all organization men, the true executive is the one who remains most suspicious of The Organization. If there is one thing that characterizes him, it is a fierce desire to control his own destiny and, deep down, he resents yielding that control to The Organization, no matter how velvety its grip... he wants to dominate, not be dominated...Many people from the great reaches of middle management can become true believers in The Organization...But the most able are not vouchsafed this solace.  </p>
