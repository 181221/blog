        <p>I just posted this on the <a href="http://community.eduglu.org/development/node/185">Eduglu community site</a>. Reposted here without further comment:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is with mixed emotions that I announce that I&#39;m quitting work on Eduglu effective immediately. I&#39;ve greatly enjoyed the time I&#39;ve spent working on Eduglu and the friendships I&#39;ve formed in person and online. I had high hopes, shared with many, in the promise of open source social learning tools but I was never able to find a business model that would make my and your work sustainable.  </p>
<p>A few other notes. This community site and eduglu.com I&#39;ll keep up and maintain for the forseeable future. All of Eduglu&#39;s source code is, of course, open source and hosted on Github and Drupal.org so if you&#39;d like to continue using/maintaining it, feel free.  </p>
<p>Now that I&#39;m not working on Eduglu I&#39;m looking for work. If you have paid part-time gigs available, send me an email. I&#39;m interested in Drupal work of course but I&#39;d be open to about anything you think I&#39;m qualified for.  </p>
<p>Hopefully this isn&#39;t a good bye and that our paths pass again in the future.  </p>
